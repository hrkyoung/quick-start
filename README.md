# Quick-start
Create a shorter alias for long commands. I made it to shorten long commands with a series of arguments or access directory-dependent scripts anywhere. 

### Installation
- clone or make a copy of the quick script
- Pick one of these:
```
#Run it from its directory
/path/to/quick <command>

#or include it to your PATH
/path/to/quick install <PATH>

#or install it to /usr/local/bin - you may need to use sudo
/path/to/quick install

#the last two will allow you to call the quick script from anywhere
```
### Use
```
Quick Start v0.1.0
Command list:
------------------
add option_name bash_command
rm option_name
disable option_name
enable option_name
install install_path
explain option_name
```
